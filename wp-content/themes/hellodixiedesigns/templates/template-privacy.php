            <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
            <p>The Company may automatically collect information about your computer hardware and software. This
                information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website
                addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the

            <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
            <p>The Company's website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a
                text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs
                or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web
                server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
            <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose
                of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
                personalize the Company's pages, or register with Company's site or services, a cookie helps the Company
                to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your
                personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the
                same website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the
                Company's features that you customized.</p>
            <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but
                you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline
                cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Company's services or
                websites you visit.</p>
